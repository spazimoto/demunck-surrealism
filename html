        <p>With a goal defined as "[resolving] the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an
            absolute reality, a super-reality", or surreality", surrealism is an art and cultural movement that uses the
            subconscious mind to express itself. Much of the art in this movement is largely non-sequitur and often
            unnerving or fantastical.</p>
